# DevWork

## Introduction
DevWork is a fully responsive single-page job board app for developers with a focus on life quality in different urban areas. It is written in HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript ES6 and leverages the Findwork.dev API and Teleport.org public API to provide the user with life quality data and tech job postings of the selected area. The app also uses the open source Leaflet JavaScript library API to provide the user a map interface for browsing different urban regions.
